# Getting Started with AnyText Utilities App

The project does some basic text manipulation tasks like converting the text to upper case / lower case.
You can copy the text from the text area, remove unwanted spaces from the given text as well as clear the
text area. There are 2 fun features that can be used to change the color of the text in the text area and read the text aloud using the window object's speechsynthesis functionality.

The project was created to understand some key concepts of React like Functional Components, props and propTypes and data manipulation using useState

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
